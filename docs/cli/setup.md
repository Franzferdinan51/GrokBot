# `grokbot setup`

`grokbot setup` is the system-agent entry point. On a configured system, bare
`grokbot setup` opens an interactive GrokBot chat. On a fresh system, it
falls through to guided onboarding. Use `-m`/`--message` for one request or
`--baseline` to initialize config/workspace folders without the wizard.

Routing order:

1. Any onboarding option (`--wizard`, `--baseline`, workspace, reset,
   non-interactive, flow, mode, Gateway, daemon, skip, import, remote, or auth
   options) runs onboarding exactly as `grokbot onboard` does.
2. `-m`/`--message` or `--yes` runs the system agent.
3. With no routing option, a configured interactive system opens GrokBot. A
   fresh system runs onboarding. On a configured system, `--json` prints the
   system overview even without a TTY; an onboarding option keeps onboarding's
   JSON summary.

In guided mode, `--workspace <dir>` is the workspace proposed to GrokBot;
it is persisted only after you approve that proposal. Baseline, classic, and
noninteractive setup persist the supplied workspace through their normal flow.

Guided inference detection runs on the Gateway host on macOS or Linux. The CLI
and macOS app call the same Gateway-owned detector, which checks configured
models, supported CLI logins, API-key environment variables, and already
installed Ollama or LM Studio models. Local models are never downloaded by this
automatic pass. Detected local runtimes are auto-tested after CLI and API-key
candidates; when several local models are available, GrokBot prefers the
strongest tool-calling instruct family. The selected candidate must answer a
real completion before its provider and model configuration is saved.
Installed Gemini, Antigravity, Pi, and OpenCode CLIs are also reported when
they cannot serve as the reusable inference route for guided setup.

`setup` accepts the same onboarding flags as `grokbot onboard`, including
auth (`--auth-choice`, `--token`, provider key flags), Gateway
(`--gateway-port`, `--gateway-bind`, `--gateway-auth`, `--install-daemon`),
Tailscale (`--tailscale`), reset (`--reset`, `--reset-scope`), flow
(`--flow quickstart|advanced|manual|import`), and skip flags
(`--skip-channels`, `--skip-skills`, `--skip-bootstrap`, `--skip-search`,
`--skip-health`, `--skip-ui`, `--skip-hooks`). Pass `--tui` to use the same
terminal hatch as `grokbot onboard --tui`. See [Onboard](/cli/onboard) and
[CLI automation](/start/wizard-cli-automation) for the full flag reference and
non-interactive examples. `grokbot onboard --modern` remains a compatibility
entry for the same inference-gated GrokBot assistant.

<Note>
`grokbot setup` is for mutable config installs. In Nix mode (`OPENCLAW_NIX_MODE=1`) GrokBot refuses setup writes because the config file is managed by Nix. Use the first-party [nix-grokbot Quick Start](https://github.com/grokbot/nix-grokbot#quick-start) or the equivalent source config for another Nix package.

## Options

| Flag                       | Description                                                                                           |

| `--non-interactive`        | Run onboarding without prompts.                                                                       |
| `--accept-risk`            | Acknowledge full-system agent access risk; required with `--non-interactive`.                         |
| `--mode <mode>`            | Onboarding mode: `local` or `remote`.                                                                 |

| `--reset`                  | Reset config + credentials + sessions before onboarding (workspace only with `--reset-scope full`).   |
| `--reset-scope <scope>`    | Reset scope: `config`, `config+creds+sessions`, or `full`.                                            |
| `--import-from <provider>` | Migration provider to run during onboarding.                                                          |
| `--import-source <path>`   | Source agent home for `--import-from`.                                                                |
| `--import-secrets`         | Import supported secrets during onboarding migration.                                                 |
| `--remote-url <url>`       | Remote Gateway WebSocket URL.                                                                         |
| `--remote-token <token>`   | Remote Gateway token (optional).                                                                      |
| `--json`                   | Configured system: GrokBot overview. Onboarding route: onboarding summary.                           |

`--classic` and `--non-interactive` are mutually exclusive: classic opens the
prompted wizard, while noninteractive setup uses the automation path.
In interactive onboarding, `--remote-url` and `--remote-token` prefill the
remote Gateway step and take precedence over stored remote values for that run.
Changing the URL does not reuse stored credentials unless you also pass a token.
The token remains masked and uses the wizard's selected plaintext or SecretRef
storage mode.

### Baseline mode

`grokbot setup --baseline` preserves the older baseline-only behavior: it
creates the config, workspace, and session directories, then exits without
running onboarding. It accepts `--workspace` and harmless output controls, but
rejects explicit onboarding, Gateway, auth, reset, or daemon options instead of
silently ignoring them.

## Examples

```bash
grokbot setup
grokbot setup -m "status"
grokbot setup -m "restart gateway" --yes
grokbot setup --json
grokbot setup --wizard
grokbot setup --baseline
grokbot setup --workspace ~/.grokbot/workspace
grokbot setup --import-from hermes --import-source ~/.hermes
grokbot setup --non-interactive --accept-risk --mode remote --remote-url wss://gateway-host:18789 --remote-token <token>
```

## Notes

- After baseline setup, run `grokbot onboard` for the full guided journey, `grokbot configure` for targeted changes, or `grokbot channels add` to add channel accounts.
- If Hermes state is detected, interactive onboarding can offer migration automatically. Import onboarding requires a fresh setup; use [Migrate](/cli/migrate) for dry-run plans, backups, and overwrite mode outside onboarding.
